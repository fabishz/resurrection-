# Product Vision & Competition Strategy

## Product Vision

RSS Renaissance resurrects RSS feeds with modern AI capabilities, making information consumption intelligent, private, and delightful. We're not building another feed reader—we're building the future of intentional content consumption.

## Competition Targets

### Grand Prize Strategy
- **Focus**: Technical excellence + innovation in AI-powered content intelligence
- **Differentiators**: Real-time deduplication across feeds, context-aware summarization, privacy-first architecture
- **Demo Hook**: Show 100+ feeds → deduplicated to 20 unique stories → summarized in seconds
- **Wow Factor**: Live demo of AI categorization with visual category clustering

### Startup Prize Strategy
- **Focus**: Market viability + clear monetization path
- **Business Model**: Freemium (5 feeds free, unlimited + AI for $5/mo)
- **Target Market**: 50M+ knowledge workers who hate algorithmic feeds
