Excited to announce RSS Renaissance - my submission for the Kiroween Hackathon! 🎃

The Problem: RSS is powerful but overwhelming. 500+ unread articles? Information overload kills productivity.

The Solution: AI-powered RSS reader that:
✨ Deduplicates 80% of repeated content across feeds
🤖 Generates intelligent summaries with GPT-4o
⚡ Works offline-first for uninterrupted reading
🔒 Privacy-focused - no tracking, local-first data

Built with Kiro AI using:
• Spec-driven development for rapid iteration
• Agent hooks for automated workflows
• Comprehensive steering rules for consistency

Target: 50M+ knowledge workers drowning in information.

Following along with the build over the next 12 days!
